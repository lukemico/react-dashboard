# README | React Burger Project

A project to explore ReacJS framework, building reusable components that utilise State + Props to render data, in the form of building a burger for a user.

- working with webpack and babel to transform, code-split, and bundle code.
- create scripts to execute commands and work with git and GitHub to track changes and share our code in public.
- build quality into our project with Jest for unit testing and ESLint for static analysis.
- configure Prettier for formatting and then enforce all these quality checks before commit with git hooks.
- incorporate some accessibility checks and enforce some best practices in React with react-axe, React's StrictMode and a default ErrorBoundary component.
